\section{MID\\}
\subsection{Class BST \\}

A BST That is used to separate the strings of different lengths. The value of the BST is a trie symbol table that will hold all of the words of this length\\\\
\textbf{Fields\\}

Node root: The starting Node of the BST
\textbf{private class Node\\}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The length of the strings affiliated with the trie.
	\item Two Node references for key values less than and key values greater then key.
	\item The value of this node will be a Trie which holds all the words of the given length.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{private void insertREC(Node node, int key, Word value)\\}

Will recursively search for the Node associated with with the inputted key. Once they key is found it will check to see if we have an undefined trie symbol table then we will instantiate one. Then we call the insert method for the trie symbol table to add the word.\\\\
\textbf{private Word[] matchPatternREC(Node node, int key, String[] regExpArray)\\}

Will recursively find the node associated with our key, Then will call the trie symbol table matchPattern method to return any word such that all of the characters match each element of the regular expression array. \\\\
\textbf{private TrieST searchREC(Node node, int key)\\}

Recursively find the Node associated with the key and will then return the trie symbol table associated with Node.\\\\
%-----------TrieST------------------
\subsection{Class TrieST}

An Implementation of a trie symbol table where the root of table will have a null character value. The table has an an array of children where each node will have a node associated with a letter  [a-z]. If this is a valid word in our dictionary then we will have Word Object within wordVal.\\\\
\textbf{Fields\\}

RNode root: The starting RNode of the trie symbol table, where the character value is the null character.\\\\
\textbf{private class RNode\\}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The character at the position the height from the root.
	\item An array of the references to Nodes that hold character next in our String.
	\item If the sequence to get to this node and this nodes value create a word, then the field wordVal will Store a Word Object.
\end{itemize}
%%%%
\textbf{private void insertWordREC(RNode node, Word wordInput,int charAT)\\}

Will first properly define the current Node if we have any null references for: The Node itself, The Node's children and there values.\\Then if we are at the length of our string, then we will set the value of wordVal to the input Word. \\ If not then we will find the next Node to visit and preform recursion on this Node.\\\\
%
\textbf{private Word searchREC(RNode node, String wordInput,int charAT)\\}

Recursively will find the Node with a path associated with wordInput. Then we will return the value of wordVal \\(returns null if it is not a word).\\\\
%
\textbf{private void matchPatternREC(RNode node, Word[] combinations, String[] regExpArray, int charAT)\\}

Checks each child to see if the regular expression regExpArray[charAT] matches the values any of the children of a this Node. If the pattern then we will preform recursion on this Node to see if the next regular expressions matches.\\ Our base case is either do not have a value or any more children where we simply return, or when we have a reached the end of our regular expression array, if we do not have a Word at this node we will return but if we do have a Word then will add this value to our array.\\\\
%-----------Word------------------
\subsection{Class Word}
\textbf{Fields\\}
